# COMPAS Masonry workshop - Part 2 (TNO)

In part 2 of this workshop, you will learn how to use COMPAS TNO to assess existing masonry structures.

## Introduction

COMPAS TNO is a Python package to find admissible thrust networks in masonry vaulted structures.

The package implements _Thrust Network Optimisation_, or TNO, within the COMPAS framework. TNO is a modular multi-objective optimisation framework to find admissible thrust networks in vaulted masonry structures. Thrust Networks represent the internal forces in masonry structures as a connected force network contained within the structural geometry. Based on the safe theorem of limit analysis, a structure is safe if at least one thrust network is found within its envelope. This set of compressive, internal forces corresponds to a lower-bound equilibrium solution.

With TNO, multiple particular equilibrium states can be obtained, including the structureâ€™s minimum and maximum horizontal thrusts, its minimum thickness, its vertical and horizontal collapse loads, and the internal stress following support movements. To find these specific structural solutions, a nonlinear optimisation problem is formulated and solved in the background. TNO sets up, runs and outputs the solution networks to these problems.

In this workshop, we will go through the base functionalities of the plug-in to assess masonry structures. For the full documentation of COMPAS TNO, please visit the following pages:

* [COMPAS TNO Homepage](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_tno/)
* [COMPAS TNO API](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_tno/latest/api.html)

## Preparation

If you already installed the base configurations of the workshop you are already all set to use the initial functionalities of COMPAS TNO. However, in this workshop you will need to obtain a license to MOSEK to run convex optimisation problems. Instructions on how to get and install a MOSEK license are listed here:

* [Download and install MOSEK license](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_tno/latest/gettingstarted/solvers.html#mosek-1)

Optional: Another option to run convex problems is to use MATLAB. If you can not install a MOSEK license and are an experieced MATLAB user, you can install the SDPT3 solver in MATLAB following these instructions:

* [Optional: Set-up MATLAB and CVX](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_tno/latest/gettingstarted/solvers.html#mosek-1)

## Basics

The workflow of **COMPAS TNO** is composed by the following four main elements summarised in the image below:

.. figure:: [../_images/workflow.png](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_tno/latest/_images/workflow.png)
    :figclass: figure
    :class: figure-img img-fluid

The steps are numbered herein.

1. The [FormDiagram](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_tno/latest/tutorial/1_form.html) defines the flow of forces in the structure.
2. The [Shape](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_tno/latest/tutorial/2_shape.html) object defines the geometry of the masonry to be analysed.
3. The [Optimiser](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_tno/latest/tutorial/3_optimiser.html) object stores the settings that will be necessary to perform the optimisation.
4. The [Analysis](https://blockresearchgroup.github.io/compas_tno/latest/tutorial/4_analysis.html) gathers the form diagram, shape and optimiser objects, performing preconditioning operations, runs the optimisation and visualises the solution.

Below we will learn how to create these elements in the following parts of the tutorial.

## Preparations

**1. Requirements**

* [Anaconda 3](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
* [Rhino 6/7](https://www.rhino3d.com/download)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Any python editor works, but we recommend [VSCode + extensions](https://compas.dev/compas/latest/gettingstarted/vscode.html)

During the installation of the various tools, just accept all default settings.
The default location for installing Anaconda is usually in the home directory.
If it isn't, try to install it there anyway.
And make sure not to register it on the `PATH` (Windows only).
On Windows, the path to the home directory is stored in the variable `%USERPROFILE%`.
On Mac, it is accessible through `~`.
This results in the following recommended installation directories for Anaconda.

*On Windows*

```
%USERPROFILE%\Anaconda3
```

*On Mac*

```
~/anaconda3
```

## Installation

** The command line**

Many instructions in the next sections will have to be run from "the command line".

On Windows, use the "Anaconda Prompt" instead of the "Command Prompt", and make sure to run it *as administrator*.

> To find the Anaconda Prompt open the Start Menu and type "Anaconda".
> The Anaconda Prompt should already show up in the list of search results.
> To launch is as administrator, right click and select "Run as administrator".

On Mac, use the "Terminal".

**For simplicity, this guide will refer to both Terminal and Anaconda Prompt as "the command line".**

![The command line](images/command_line.png)

We will use the command line to install the COMPAS Python packages (and their dependencies) required for the workshop.

> **NOTE**: If you're on Windows, all commands below have to be executed in the *Anaconda Prompt* (NOT the *Command Prompt*)

We use `conda` to make sure we have clean, isolated environment for dependencies.

<details><summary>First time using <code>conda</code>?</summary>
<p>

Make sure you run this at least once:

    (base) conda config --add channels conda-forge

</p>
</details>

    (base) conda env create -f https://github.com/BRG-teaching/WS_Segovia23/blob/main/environment.yml

### Add to Rhino

    (base)  conda activate WS_Segovia23
    (WS_Segovia23) python -m compas_rhino.install -v 7.0

If this is the first time you are using Rhino for Windows, or if you have never opened its
PythonScriptEditor before, do so now: open Rhino and open the editor by typing `EditPythonScript`.
Then simply close Rhino again.

To check the installation, launch Rhino, open the PythonScriptEditor, and try
importing the COMPAS packages in a script.
Then run the script and if no errors pop up, you are good to go.

```python
import compas
import compas_rhino
import compas_assembly
```

### Get the workshop files

Clone the repository:

```
(WS_Segovia23) cd Documents
(WS_Segovia23) git clone https://github.com/BRG-teaching/WS_Segovia23.git
```

### Verify installation

    (WS_Segovia23) python -m compas

    Yay! COMPAS is installed correctly!

    COMPAS: 1.17.0
    Python: 3.9.13 (CPython)
    Extensions: ['compas-cgal', 'compas-gmsh', 'compas-rrc', 'compas-fab', 'compas-occ', 'compas-view2']

## Help
